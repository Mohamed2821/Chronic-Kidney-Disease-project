Chronic Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting chronic kidney disease (CKD) using machine learning techniques. The goal is to assist in early detection by analyzing patient medical data and identifying patterns associated with chronic disease risk.

The model processes clinical attributes such as blood test results and physiological indicators to classify whether a patient is likely to have chronic kidney disease.

🎯 Objectives

Perform data preprocessing and cleaning on medical datasets

Handle missing values and categorical variables

Train and evaluate machine learning models

Predict the presence of chronic kidney disease

Improve early diagnosis support using data-driven methods

🗂️ Dataset

File name: kidney_disease.csv

Source: Publicly available CKD dataset

Type: Structured medical dataset

Target Variable: Chronic Kidney Disease (Yes / No)

The dataset includes clinical features such as age, blood pressure, albumin, sugar levels, blood urea, serum creatinine, hemoglobin, and more.
